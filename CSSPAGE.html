    <P> <strong> CSS is the Short of Cascading Style Sheet </strong>  and is being used to  describe how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media   </P>

It can also different designed of the html elements. Once it is used it can have an effect on many elements at once.<br>
There are three ways of doing it :
<ol>
<li> Inline : Meaning within the html elements</li>
<li>Internal : Meaning specifying the Selectors under the Header element</li>
<li>External: Meaning to get link html pages externally (creating CSS PAGE) separately</li>
</ol>
for example , you can use DIV to divide your information in different section separatelly and when applying CSS you can make changes at once.

<div class="Department">

<h1>Computer Science Department</h1>
<p> This Department teaches differents courses and also has qualified staff and well Committed</p>
